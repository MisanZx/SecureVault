## Introduction

Virtual Machine Management

VMware Workstation enables users to create, configure, and manage virtual machines. It supports features such as:

* **Snapshots**: Save the state of a virtual machine at any point in time and revert to it later.
* **Cloning**: Create copies of virtual machines for testing and development purposes.
* **Grouping**: Group multiple virtual machines in an inventory folder to manage them as a single entity.

It provides you an environment you can use for testing as if it was a real environment without the risk of damaging assets in production.
