# Misan's Custom Sandbox

## Why create your own sandbox?

Creating your own sandbox tailors the instance exactly how you want it so if you ever go from one place to another you will have the ideal setup that is right for you.



This is a discovery process and it will always be a developing and live instance.&#x20;

_Remember to take backups and Snapshots._



## My Setups

Windows:

* No MS Defender installed
* Remove all bloatware
* Install well known Office products
* Install Sublime - Text Editor
* Install other testing tools - to build a longer list
* Gamebar off
* Hide desktop icons
* Taskbar on the left
* Bluetooth off
* Disable Print Spooler
* Do not allow Camera and microphone access
* Darkmode on system wide.

_This list will actively change and my honest reviews will be shared below._

_Linux:_

_I currently use REMnux but may make my own soon tbc._
