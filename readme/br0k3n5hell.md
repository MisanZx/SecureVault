## Intro

What I find most interesting is finding out what your "drive is" that helps you become more engaged to keep on learning to find the answer. for me, I like the ways in thinking on why such an actor would think in the way they would. One of my favorite anime was "The Monster" which I really enjoyed and was hooked that inspires me a lot today in the way that I am to think like the bad guy, but on the blue defense side what piece I should be move where possible to negate the attack when they are on the offensive.

## General Skills

Most of these skills will be all within the Linux environment, so buckle up. We all have our favorite Distros' of what is best. As long as you are familiar with it that is good enough for you then you can build out from there and make a snapshot of how exactly you want it to be. One that I have been using a lot is [ParrotSec](https://parrotsec.org/).

So you got your Distro up and ready to go.

So lets go!!
