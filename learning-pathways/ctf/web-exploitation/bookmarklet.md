# Bookmarklet

Author: Jeffery John

**Description**

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:63685/), and find the flag!



Hint 1

A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.



Hint 2

What happens when you click a bookmarklet?



Hint 3

Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.

Upon opening the page im presented with:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

hmm within the middle box I have this:



<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The encrypted flag is what we are after but looks encrypted so we need to figure out how to decode this.

**Bookmarklets** are usually small snippets of JavaScript executed when user clicks on them. When clicked, bookmarklets can perform a wide variety of operations, such as running a search query from selected text or extracting data from a table.

When inspecting the element it takes me to this line and expanding it out it highlights this line of code:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

what I think this means is that when the javascript is put in it should be the flag.

to run the code we found before we should be able to get the flag.
