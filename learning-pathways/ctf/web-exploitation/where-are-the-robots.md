# where are the robots

Author: zaratec/Danny

**Description**

Can you find the robots? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915



Hint 1

What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?



***

On clicking the link I get:

A robots.txt file contains instructions for bots that tell them which webpages they can and cannot access. Robots.txt files are most relevant for web crawlers from search engines like Google.

example

`websiteaddress/robots.txt`

I copied this part of the string to the web browser and found the flag.
