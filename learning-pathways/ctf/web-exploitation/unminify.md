# Unminify

Author: Jeffery John

**Description**

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:62871/), and find the flag!



Hint 1

Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.

Hint 2

Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.

Hint 3

What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

***

Launch the resource, I was presented with:



<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Control + U to display the html page.

This is what developers use for css and website formatting etc.

From there I did a search for the flag and found:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Flag found.
