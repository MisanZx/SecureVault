#### Managing Insider risk

Insider risk management policies are created using pre-defined templates and policy conditions.

It is to note that each policy must have a template assigned in the policy creation wizard before the policy is created.

Search and investigate with Microsoft Purview Audit

Audit (Standard) offers a maximum retention period of 180 days.

Audit log search needs to be enabled with the Get-AdminAuditLogConfig command.

MailItemsAccessed is important for providing detailed records of how and when email items are accessed, essential for managing sensitive communications.

Exporting audit logs to CSV enables extensive data manipulation and deeper insights, essential for compliance and detailed analysis.

Administrators set a priority level to determine which policy takes precedence if there are conflicts.

1. Open a blank workbook in Excel and navigate to the **Data** tab. Select **From Text/CSV** to open your exported CSV file
2. Once the CSV file opens, select **Transform Data** to begin editing in the Power Query Editor.
3. Right-click **AuditData**, select **Transform**, then choose **JSON** in the **Query Editor**. This step transforms the data into a readable format, creating separate columns for each property within the JSON object.
4. Select the expand icon in the upper-right corner of the **AuditData** column to see a list of properties in the JSON objects.
5. If only some properties are visible initially, select **Load more** to display the full list of properties in the JSON objects.
6. Deselect any properties you don't need to simplify your data view. This helps in focusing only on relevant data for your analysis.
7. Then change columns on the ones you want.

You can download a maximum of 50,000 entries to a CSV file from a single audit log search. If your search results exceed this limit, consider using a narrower date range to manage the volume of data.
